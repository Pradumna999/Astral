# Project Title

**Orbital Atlas — Real‑time, ultra‑realistic Earth + Satellite Simulation (Three.js)**

## Short Summary

Build a highly realistic, interactive 3D Earth simulation (Three.js) with live satellite positions, orbital trajectories, pass predictions, and NASA‑style mission info. Think *satellitemap.space* + *Google Earth* vibes — but lightweight, web-first, and developer-friendly on Replit.

## Goals / MVP

1. Render a photoreal Earth (day/night, clouds, atmosphere scattering, specular ocean) using Three.js.
2. Show hundreds to thousands of satellites in real time (positions updated every few seconds) with smooth orbital trails.
3. Client-side orbital propagation using TLE data so updates feel instant and scale is efficient.
4. Selection UI: click a satellite → show a NASA-like info card (name, operator, mission, launch date, orbit params, next pass, footprint).
5. Controls: time scrubber (play/pause/real-time/fast-forward), filter by object type/operator/orbit, search, and follow/center-on-satellite.
6. Server component (optional but recommended): fetch and cache TLEs periodically from public sources, provide a WebSocket or REST API for clients.
7. Clean, responsive UI with map and list views; lightweight performance on desktop and mobile.




## Key Features (detailed)

### Visual & Globe

* Physically plausible atmosphere shader (horizon glow, Rayleigh/Mie scattering).
* Day/night texture blending + city lights at night.
* High-res cloud layer with subtle parallax.
* Adjustable lighting (sun position by real UTC / simulated time).

### Satellites & Orbits

* Client-side propagation using `satellite.js` from latest TLEs.
* Smooth orbital trails rendered with GPU instancing or dynamic line segments.
* Footprint visualization (coverage circle) and ground track.
* Elevation / altitude heat visualization (optional).

### Interaction / Controls

* Click/select satellites → info panel (mission summary, NORAD ID, operator, launch date, orbital elements, current velocity/altitude, predicted passes).
* Search & filter (name, NORAD id, operator, orbital regime (LEO/GEO/SSO/etc.), constellation).
* Follow mode: camera locks to satellite with contextual HUD.
* Time controls: realtime sync, pause, step, speed multiplier, jump to pass time.
* Notification panel for upcoming passes / possible conjunctions (UI only; no automatic interference).

### Backend & Realtime

* Scheduled TLE fetcher (e.g., every 6–12 hours) with caching and rate-limit handling.
* WebSocket endpoint for pushing TLE update notifications and optional per-satellite telemetry.
* REST endpoints for historical queries or bulk data download (JSON).

## Performance & Scalability Notes

* Use GPU instancing if gpu is available for thousands of point/sprite satellites.
* Downsample trail history for long trails; LOD based on camera distance.
* Propagate positions client-side per-frame (satellite.js) to avoid server compute load.
* Throttle websocket updates — clients can update locally between server pushes.

## UX / UI Ideas

* Left panel: searchable list (group by operator/constellation), quick-follow buttons.
* Right panel: selected satellite details and links to external resources (CelesTrak, N2YO, Wikipedia, NASA).
* Overlay toggles: labels, ground tracks, footprints, orbital plane vectors.
* Mini map 2D projection for bird’s-eye quick navigation.

## Security & Ethics

* Respect rate limits and API terms (Space-Track requires credentials).
* Display clear attribution for data sources (CelesTrak/NASA/Open APIs).
* No functionality for active interference or anything that would facilitate wrongdoing; keep features informational.

## UI/UX Acceptance Criteria

* Earth renders at >30 FPS on modern desktop; graceful degrade on mobile.
* Selecting a satellite opens a details card with correctly propagated real-time position (within expected TLE propagation error).
* Time scrubber controls propagate through the scene and update satellite positions instantly.
* WebSocket or REST integration demonstrates live TLE refresh without page reload.

## Nice-to-Have / Future Enhancements

* Terrain elevation (DEM) and 3D buildings (Cesium-level detail — optional).
* Ground-station network simulation and pass predictions with visibility windows.
* Export snapshot (PNG) and small shareable URL to focus on a satellite/time.
* Conjunction analysis tools and batch alerts (experimental/advanced).
* AR overlay mode for mobile devices.

## Development Milestones

1. Basic globe + satellite points using sample TLEs (satellite.js).
2. Selection + info panel + time controls.
3. Real-time TLE fetcher & WebSocket sync.
4. Visual polish (atmosphere, clouds, trails, HUD).
5. Scalability/LOD and final UX polish.

optimize it for good performance
